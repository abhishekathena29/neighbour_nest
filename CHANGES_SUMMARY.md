# Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to fix issues and implement new features in the NeighbourNest application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Render Flow Error in Customer Dashboard ✅
**Issue:** The customer dashboard was experiencing render flow errors due to `addPostFrameCallback` being called repeatedly in the build method.

**Solution:** 
- Moved the service loading logic to `initState()` 
- Added a flag `_servicesLoaded` to ensure services are only loaded once
- File: `lib/features/dashboard/presentation/screens/customer_dashboard.dart`

### 2. Back Button Navigation Errors ✅
**Issue:** Back buttons in auth screens were causing "nothing to pop" errors when navigated to directly via `context.go()`.

**Solution:**
- Updated all back button handlers to check `context.canPop()` before calling `context.pop()`
- Added fallback navigation to appropriate screens when nothing can be popped
- Files modified:
  - `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/user_type_selection_screen.dart`
  - `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/almost_there_screen.dart`
