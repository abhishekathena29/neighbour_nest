# Auth Pages Redesign Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the redesign of authentication pages and navigation flow improvements for the NeighbourNest application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Render Flow Error in User Type Selection Screen ✅
**Issue:** The user type selection page had a `Spacer()` widget causing render flow errors when there wasn't enough vertical space.

**Solution:** 
- Wrapped the entire content in `SingleChildScrollView` to make it scrollable
- Removed `Spacer()` and replaced with fixed `SizedBox` spacing
- Added "Already have an account?" link at the bottom
- File: `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/user_type_selection_screen.dart`

### 2. Updated Navigation Flow ✅
**Issue:** After selecting user type, the flow wasn't properly connecting to signup with the selected type.

**Solution:**
- Updated user type selection to navigate to signup screen with the selected `UserType`
- "I want to offer skills" → Opens signup with `UserType.contributor`
- "I want to find skills" → Opens signup with `UserType.customer`
- User type is now passed as a parameter to the signup screen
- Removed old onboarding flow (share-skills-form, almost-there screens remain for future use)

    context.pop();
  } else {
    context.go('/fallback-route');
  }
}
```

### Responsive Design
All screens use `ResponsiveWrapper` for adaptive padding:
```dart
ResponsiveWrapper(
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(context.responsivePadding),
    child: content,
  ),
)
```
