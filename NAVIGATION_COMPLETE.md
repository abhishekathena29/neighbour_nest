- Forms (Almost There, Share Skills)
- Results (Contributors, Skill Requests)
- Old auth screens (Login, Signup, Forgot Password)

### Protected Access
Dashboard screens require authentication:
- Main dashboard
- Contributor dashboard

### Redirect Behavior
- Unauthenticated users accessing protected routes → Redirected to `/welcome`
- Authenticated users opening app → Go directly to `/dashboard`
- All public routes remain accessible regardless of auth state
